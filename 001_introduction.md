## 1.  What is MinDoc?

- **What is MinDoc?**  [MinDoc](https://github.com/TonLeon/mindoc) is a digital documentary publishing template that anyone can use to create a high-quality digital edition of a historical source. MinDoc has been designed to meet the basic [standards for digital editions](https://www.documentaryediting.org/wordpress/?page_id=508) set by the [Association for Documentary Editing](https://www.documentaryediting.org/wordpress/), while also incorporating [minimal computing](http://digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/16/2/000646/000646.html) design principles. It requires only very basic computing resources, while at the same time teaching users some important coding skills. MinDoc was developed by researchers at [SourceLab](https://experts.illinois.edu/en/activities/sourcelab-journal), a digital humanities collective based at the [University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign](https://illinois.edu/). It is distributed freely for any use under an [MIT license](https://opensource.org/license/MIT/).

- **How Does MinDoc Work?** MinDoc is a template (or model) that can be used to create a simple but effective website containing your edition. This website may be hosted almost anywhere and made as open or as private as you like. You’ll build it on Github—a freely-accessible space for programmers and web developers, used all over the world—using a built-in software tool called [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) . You don’t need to know how to install or use Jekyll (unless you want to). It’s possible to build your whole site online on Github.  It works best if you take the time to learn a few simple coding concepts, and a very basic (and easy) tool for formatting your text, called Markdown. (Widely used, Markdown will give you a skill you can bring to all kinds of projects and jobs in the future.) But, strictly speaking, all you’ll really need to have to get your site built is patience, a willingness to play around, and some content. MinDoc can guide you on how to build the rest!

- **What Can MinDoc Publish?** MinDoc is designed to put almost any kind of digital file onto the Web: from images to sounds to texts to video.  More specifically, MinDoc publishes digital documents together with the information people need to use these sources to discuss, analyze, and provide evidence for history.  By placing your documents in this frame, you can help create a better historical record online, so that students, teachers, researchers, members of the public, and future generations can make use of them.

-  **What Kind of Website Will MinDoc Produce?** MinDoc will help you create a so-called ‘static’ website. This means that your website will not be dynamically updated by an external database. It won’t feature new content based on automatic updates, it won’t auto-populate content based on user preference, or anything else like that. What you put in is what will be shown on the page. The advantage of a static website over other kinds of sites, however, is that they are simple to host. Because they don’t depend on external resources like databases, they are also easier to preserve (a valuable thing for a documentary edition).

- **What Will I Learn as I Do This?** You’ll learn to edit basic files and gain elementary coding skills in the elementary programming language Markdown. This, in turn, will help prepare you to produce web content across a number of different platforms—blogs, e-journals, websites, social media, newsletters—and help you get ready to tackle more advanced web development skills. You’ll also get introduced to the world of [Github](https://github.com/)—a universe of content by programmers and scholars all over the world—as well as the principles of documentary editing that shape scholarly efforts to publish the past today. For a larger course on the craft of documentary editing, see the wonderful [eLaboratories](https://elaboratories.org/) website produced by the [University of Virginia’s](https://www.virginia.edu/) [Center for Digital Editing](https://centerfordigitalediting.org/), in collaboration with the [National Archives](https://www.archives.gov/).
